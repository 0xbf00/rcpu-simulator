# rcpu-simulator

A simple simulator for a simple RISC instruction set we developed during
our project 'Mikrorechner' at the university of Hamburg in 2014 and 2015.

Building has been tested on OS X and Ubuntu, with _clang_ >= 600.0.57 
and _gcc_ >= 4.8.2, though any C compiler supporting C11 should suffice.

Care has been taken to properly document the source code, so documentation
can be automatically generated by _appledoc_.
